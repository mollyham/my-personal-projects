                        Iâ€™ve been fascinated by Justice from a young age.
                        The ability to solve conflicts is one of the most useful and essential skills one can develop in
                        school and college.
                        I also believe that mathematical sciences can be fun and exciting to learn if you teach them the
                        right way.
                        I always strive to improve my skills and develop innovative and more effective teaching
                        strategies.

            I am an outgoing Middle School Math Teacher dedicated to building an atmosphere that will encourage
            efficient learning of primary math concepts.
            Working closely with students, I can easily determine all their strengths and weaknesses needed to create
            personalized lesson plans.
            I focus on the development and implementation of flexible programs that meet curriculum standards.
            Being a math teacher for more than 10 years I take great responsibility for developing and supporting
            learning programs for faculty, teachers, staff, and students.
            I also have extensive experience in the classroom and working in mixed student and academic affairs. My
            research interests include issues related to first-year students, high achievers, and educational
            institutions
